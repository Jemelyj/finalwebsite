    <h1>The Renaissance Room</h1>
    <p>"Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it." — Michelangelo Buonarroti</p>

  <div class="intro">
    <p><strong>In this gallery we will be introducing two of the most well known Renaissance masters, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Sofonisba Anguissola.</strong> Michelangelo, known for his excellent sculpture, painting, and architecture, transformed the art world with a variety of works through painting and sculpting. His thorough understanding of human anatomy, as well as his ability to express powerful emotions, have cemented his place in Western art history.<br><br>

    Unlike many of the male artists who dominated during this time, Sofonisba Anguissola, one of the few Renaissance women who rose to prominence, was known for her groundbreaking portraits that effectively combined technical talent with emotive impact. Her works, particularly her Chess Game and self-portraits, succeeded to reshape the role of women in art, defying traditional expectations. Despite working in two different genres, both artists made significant contributions to the world of art, and their work continues to inspire and motivate artists of all generations today.</p>
