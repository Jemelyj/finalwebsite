    <p>One of the greatest artists of all time, Michelangelo Buonarroti was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect, and poet. Among his most well-known creations are the sculpture of David and the Vatican's Sistine Chapel ceiling. He was born in 1475. Although he was talented in many areas, he is best known for his sculptures that bring stone to life and his paintings that feature strong, emotive people. He had a huge impact on Western art and was instrumental in the development of the High Renaissance.</p>

      <h3>Self Portrait On The Wall Of The Sistine Chapel (1500)</h3>

      <p>Around 1500, Michelangelo painted a self-portrait in the Sistine Chapel, which is a minor but important addition to his masterpiece. The artist is portrayed in the painting as a flayed man clutching his own skin on the altar wall of the Last Judgment fresco. According to critics, this might be a reflection of Michelangelo's inner turmoil, expressing his personal anguish and nuanced relationship with God.</p>

      <p>One of the most well-known pieces of art in the world is Michelangelo's painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The frescoes, which depict episodes from the Book of Genesis, occupy more than 5,000 square feet and were commissioned by Pope Julius II. The dramatic Creation of Adam, in which God gives Adam life with an almost loving hand, is a centerpiece of the composition.</p>

      <p>This iconic fresco shows God reaching out to touch Adam’s finger, symbolizing the spark of life. It has become one of the most reproduced and analyzed works of art ever made, known for its dramatic expression, physicality, and emotional tension.</p>

      <p>Completed in 1499 and housed in St. Peter’s Basilica, this sculpture captures the Virgin Mary cradling Jesus’ lifeless body. It’s revered for its emotional power, graceful lines, and technical mastery. Michelangelo's representation of grief and beauty is one of his most celebrated achievements.</p>
